# 📧 SMS Spam Detection System Using NLP

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200.png?text=SMS+Spam+Detection+System+Using+NLP)

## 🚀 Overview

Welcome to the SMS Spam Detection System! This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam). Developed during an internship with AICTE's "AI: Transformative Learning with TechSaksham"—a joint CSR initiative by Microsoft and SAP focusing on AI technologies—this system aims to enhance communication safety by filtering out unwanted messages.
